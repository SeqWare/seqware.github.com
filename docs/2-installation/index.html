<h1>Installation</h1>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environment">
<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>SeqWare is designed to work in a 64-bit Linux environment, we do not support Windows
or MacOS.  You can still use SeqWare on your local Mac or Windows PC through
virtualization software.  You need to be comfortable with Linux before moving
forward with SeqWare, specifically the Bash shell, using an editor like vim or
emacs, and some experience programming in Java is extremely helpful.</p>

<p>To learn about Linux, the Bash shell, and Java we recommend the O&#8217;Reilly series of books:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://amzn.com/B0093T2G3I">Linux in a Nutshell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.com/B0043GXMSY">Learning the bash Shell</a></li>
<li><a href="http://amzn.com/B0043EWVDI">Learning Java</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="option-1-client-only">
<h2>Option 1 - Client Only</h2>

<p>This is the option for you if your environment already has a SeqWare
installation and you just want to download the client tool for interacting with
the system.  It lets you generate reports, write new workflows, install those
workflows on the remote SeqWare system, schedule workflows remotely, etc.  Keep
in mind most sites do not have SeqWare already configured and you will typically
always want to use Options 1 or 2 below instead.</p>

<p>To install the client only, first download the command line SeqWare tool to a
location in your path (make sure you mark it as executable).  Next, copy the
archetype-catalog.xml file to you ~/.m2 directory.  This assumes you have Maven
3.x installed and are running in a Linux environment.  The SeqWare command line
will automatically download the latest SeqWare release and create a basic
~/.seqware/settings file when you first run it.  Keep in mind you will need to
get various settings for your ~/.seqware/settings file from the person who set
it up your SeqWare install.</p>

<p>You can find the SeqWare command line tool and the archetype-catalog.xml on our
<a href="https://github.com/SeqWare/seqware/releases">releases</a> GitHub page.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="option-2-installing-with-a-local-vm">
<h2>Option 2 - Installing with a Local VM</h2>

<p>We have created a VirtualBox VM with all SeqWare projects pre-installed along
with some sample data.  This is the easiest way to get started with SeqWare
since it requires no installation and configuration on your part.  While the
download is pretty large, you will not incur per hour fees as you do when
running on Amazon so it is a great way to get started with SeqWare, kick the
tires, and see if this is something you want to use.</p>

<div class="section" id="getting-the-vm">
<h3>Getting the VM</h3>

<p>Getting the local VM is a two-step process.  First, download (or install via
your OS&#8217;s package management system) the VirtualBox application. This is a
great piece of software that will let you run the SeqWare CentOS VM on whatever
OS you currently have.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Oracle Virtual Box</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you will need to download our current VM image which is linked below.
Please make sure you are using the latest version, when we post a new one we
will tweet about it so consider following us on Twitter.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/oicr.vm/public/Seqware_1.0.13_Bindle_1.2_pre-release.ova">SeqWare-1.0.13.ova</a></li>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/oicr.vm/public/Seqware_1.0.13_Bindle_1.2.1.ova">SeqWare-1.0.13.ova (this is the VM we recommend for the ICGC PanCancer project for data train 2.0)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Open VirtualBox and use the &#8220;Import Appliance&#8221; tool to create a new SeqWare VM
on your system. Make sure you set the memory to the max you can afford, I
recommend at least 12GB of memory for the VM.  You can then launch it and you
will be presented with a fairly standard Linux desktop with links to the
project&#8217;s documentation to give you an idea of where to begin (the &#8220;Getting
Started&#8221; guide here provides a walk-through of using this VM).</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>
When you import the VM ensure that &#8220;Reinitialize the MAC address of all network cards&#8221; is NOT checked. (<a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=43090">Why?</a>) </p>




<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>
When you import the VM you need to set your memory and CPU correctly.  Do not
over-commit resources (especially memory) since that will cause the machine to
&#8220;swap&#8221; memory to disk and slow your computer to a crawl. This VM is intended
for you to see SeqWare in action and then create your own workflows. If you are
making a workflow that will take 16GB of memory then you will need a VM running
on a machine that can afford to give 16GB of memory to VirtualBox.  Also, we
only distribute 64-bit VMs which all modern PCs will support and VirtualBox
makes use of various virtualization extensions which most modern PCs support
(but you may want to check with your computer vendor).  </p>


</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-in">
<h3>Logging In</h3>

<p>The login username is <kbd>vagrant</kbd> and the password is <kbd>vagrant</kbd>. If you need to become <kbd>root</kbd> use <kbd>sudo bash</kbd>.</p>

<p>By default the VM will open port 2222 for ssh. You can connect to the running VM from an external console using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sshpass -p 'vagrant' ssh -p 2222 vagrant@localhost
</code></pre>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>
Obviously, you will not want to run this VM anywhere that is network-accessible. If you do, make sure to disable the above login and use SSH keys.
</p>


</div>
<div class="section" id="what-can-you-do-with-it">
<h3>What Can You Do With It?</h3>

<p>As the note above mentioned, you can use this VM to see what each of the
SeqWare tools can do, kick the tires, explore the docs more, etc. If you decide
to use SeqWare then this VM can also be your development and testing
environment for workflows.  Once you have created and tested a given workflow,
you can also use the SeqWare commands on this machine to &#8220;install&#8221; the workflow
bundle into a production system.  Or you can even hook up this VM to a real
local grid environment (such as an SGE cluster) for running workflows.  This is
exactly what we did at OICR, our SeqWare hosts are all virtual machines that
can submit workflow jobs to our physical cluster. You can find more information
on this in the &#8220;SeqWare Pipeline&#8221; section of our documentation.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="option-3-installing-with-a-cloud-vm">
<h2>Option 3 -Installing with a Cloud VM</h2>

<p>We currently support running SeqWare on the Amazon cloud on HPC nodes. These
are high-performance, cluster-compute nodes well suited for research, for specs
see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/">Cluster Compute Quadruple Extra Large
Instance</a>. These machines provide
23GB of memory and 2x quad core &#8220;Nehalem&#8221; processors which is typically
sufficient for analyzing a human exome within about 4 hours depending on the
specifics of your workflows.</p>

<p>For development purposes, we have also have had success with m1.xlarge
instances. For noninteractive build and integration tests, we have also had
success with the m1.medium instance type. However, note that these instance
types are not recommended for production use.</p>

<p>If you are interested in building complete clusters on the Amazon cloud please
see Option 4 below. Even for single-node SeqWare deployments Option 4 provides
more control and a greater diversity of instance types for running.  However,
just launching an AMI as described in this option is extremely fast and easy,
it is really the best way to explore SeqWare with the least amount of work.</p>

<div class="section" id="getting-an-amazon-cloud-account">
<h3>Getting an Amazon Cloud Account</h3>

<p>To use Amazon&#8217;s cloud (also know as Amazon Web Services or AWS) you need to
sign up for an account and that requires a credit card.  Also, while launching
these instances is simply point and click using Amazon&#8217;s very nice AWS console,
actually using these machines requires the same level of experience as using
the local VM above.  If you are looking for a completely graphical, web-based
service you should consider using one of the cloud-based providers like Nimbus
Informatics or DNAnexus.</p>

<p>Signup for the Amazon cloud <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">here</a></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="running-the-vm">
<h3>Running the VM</h3>

<p>What makes Amazon&#8217;s cloud so amazingly awesome is its excellent support for
both graphical UIs and programmatic APIs for controlling the cloud.  It is your
choice on how you want to launch the VM, either through the console or via one
of the many command line and programmatic tools available. The details are
subject to change so we refer to Amazon&#8217;s thorough
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/">documentation</a>. Specifically
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html">this</a> guide
should be very helpful in learning how to use Linux VMs on Amazon&#8217;s cloud.</p>

<div class="section" id="stable-public-ami-s">
<h4>Stable Public AMI(s):</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<strong> ami-80af40e8 </strong>
: 20140514 (SeqWare-1.0.13, Bindle 1.2 pre-release) Make sure you launch in Virginia and select the instance type &#8220;m1.xlarge&#8221; since the AMI is designed specifically to work with this type (we use the local disks provided by this instance).</li>
<li>
<strong> ami-b1e9f4d8 DEPRECATED</strong>
: 20140409 (SeqWare-1.0.13, Bindle 1.2 pre-release) Make sure you launch in Virginia and select the instance type &#8220;m1.xlarge&#8221; since the AMI is designed specifically to work with this type (we use the local disks provided by this instance).</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of the launching wizard in the Amazon AWS console can be seen below:</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/images/amazon_launcher.png" alt="SeqWare AWS Console" width="600px"></p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong>Make sure you open port 22 for SSH, port 8080 for the SeqWare Portal and Web Service, and port 80 for our landing page that you can access at http://ec2hostname/, you fill in ec2hostname with the name of the server Amazon provisions for you.</p>


</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-in">
<h3>Logging In</h3>

<p>There is no graphical desktop to log into.  Instead you will need to follow the directions on the Amazon site for using <kbd>ssh</kbd> to log into your running VM.  There you will have a command line interface to interact with the SeqWare tools. You can also view the SeqWare Portal and SeqWare Web Service remotely in your browser if you have previously opened the ports 22, 8080, and 80.</p>

<p>Specifically, follow <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html">this</a> Amazon guide for logging into your SeqWare instance using ssh.</p>

<p>You will want to login as the &#8220;ubuntu&#8221; user and then use &#8220;sudo su - seqware&#8221; to become the SeqWare user and walk through the steps of the tutorials.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="what-can-you-do-with-it">
<h3>What Can You Do With It?</h3>

<p>You can launch this public AMI which will give you a server with all the
SeqWare projects pre-configured and loaded with some small examples.  You can
then use the running VM to test workflows and write your own.  Since this VM
runs on the fairly powerful HPC node type, you can actually use it to get real
work done.  This instance is powerful enough to analyze a whole human exome in
4-8 hours and you can, of course, launch many instances simultaneously to
process multiple exomes in parallel. Future releases of SeqWare will include
scripts to setup clusters of HPC nodes that will allow you to process whole
human genomes. In the mean time we recommend investigating the excellent
<a href="http://star.mit.edu/cluster/">StarCluster</a> cluster launching tool.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>Keep in mind Amazon charges approximately $1.30 USD per hour to run these instances, it is your responsibility to monitor your cloud usage and turn your VMs off when not in use!  You will be billed for each hour (rounded up).</p>

<div class="section" id="option-4-installing-from-scratch">
<h2>Option 4 - Installing from Scratch</h2>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>We do not recommend you attempt to do
this unless you a familiar with Linux and a cloud/virtualization
technology such as VirtualBox, OpenStack, Google Compute Engine, or Amazon Web
Services.</p>


<p>This option leverages the excellent <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a></p>
