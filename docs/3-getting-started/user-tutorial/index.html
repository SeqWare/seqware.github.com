<h1>User Tutorial</h1>

<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>This guide assumes you have installed
SeqWare already. If you have not, please install SeqWare by either downloading
the VirtualBox VM or launching the AMI on the Amazon cloud.  See <a href="../../2-installation/">Installation</a> for directions.</p>

<p>The majority of this guide is dedicated to walking users (people who use
workflows) through the basics of using SeqWare. The core functionality we will
explore is how to get data into the system, how to run workflows someone else
created and installed for you, and getting the resulting data back out.  We
assume that people are most interested in the Pipeline sub-project and focus
most of our time on that.  The examples below will all be based on a local
VirtualBox VM but the environment on our cloud instance is almost identical, so
most of the examples below will be applicable to either VM type. Any difference
will be pointed out in a tip box.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="by-the-end-of-this-tutorial">
<h2>By the End of This Tutorial</h2>

<p>This guide will show you how to use command line tools from Pipeline to access
the MetaDB via the Web Service in order to setup workflows to run in Pipeline,
watch over them, and get results back. This will allow you to do the following
tasks using tools that can be scripted versus our Portal web-based interface
that requires a user to click on an interface. By the end of these tutorials
you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>use command line tools from Pipeline as a workflow user</li>
  <li>create studies, experiments, and samples in the MetaDB</li>
  <li>associate data such as fastq files with particular samples in the MetaDB</li>
  <li>find the list of available workflows and the parameters they accept</li>
  <li>schedule a HelloWorld workflow and monitor its progress</li>
  <li>generate a report on the outputs of your workflows</li>
  <li>download files produced by a workflow</li>
  <li>debug workflows by downloading stdout and stderr for your workflows</li>
  <li>cancel and restart workflows</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="first-steps">
<h2>First Steps</h2>

<p>Please launch your local VM in VirtualBox or cloud AMI on Amazon now.  For the
local VM, login as user <kbd>seqware</kbd>, password <kbd>seqware</kbd> at this
time. Click on the “SeqWare Directory” link on the desktop which will open a
terminal to the location where we installed the SeqWare tools.</p>

<p>Alternatively, on the Amazon AMI follow the directions to log in
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html">here</a>.
Make sure that you launch our VM with the “cc1.4xlarge” instance type.
Also, please wait roughly 10 minutes for our startup scripts to run and fully setup your instance.</p>

<p>Once logging into the remote instance you need to “switch user” to
<kbd>seqware</kbd>, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo su - seqware
</code></pre>

<p>In some instances using AWS, it may be necessasry to run <code>sudo umount /dev/xvdc</code> as ubuntu user before switching to seqware user.</p>

<p>Both the VirtualBox VM and Amazon AMI include a start page that links to key information
for the VM such as the URLs for the installed Portal, Web Service, key file locations, etc.
On the VirtualBox VM, just click the “Start Here” link on the desktop.  For the Amazon instance
use the instance name provided by the AWS console. For example, it will look similar to:</p>

<pre><code>http://ec2-54-224-22-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com
</code></pre>

<p>You fill in your instance DNS name from the Amazon console in place of ec2-54-224-22-195.compute-1.amazonaws.com above. Make sure you check your security group settings to ensure port 80 (and the other ports referenced in the landing page) are open.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-example">
<h2>The Example</h2>

<p>In this tutorial we will use a simple HelloWorld workflow that takes a text
file as input and creates another file as output. The same examples could be
applied to any workflow and input data types.  How to build your own workflows
(<strong>which is really the central purpose of SeqWare</strong>) is covered in the
<a href="../developer-tutorial/">Developer Tutorial</a>. How to
install these workflows and present them to users is covered in the <a href="../admin-tutorial/">Admin
Tutorial</a>.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Cloud Tip:</strong>Any differences between the local
VirtualBox VM and Amazon cloud AMI will be described in a &#8220;Cloud Tip&#8221; box like
this one.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-seqware-command-line-interface">
<h2>The SeqWare Command Line Interface</h2>

<p>The SeqWare command line interface (CLI) will allow you to perform common SeqWare operations, and delegate work to the SeqWare Web service (whether it is on a VM, installed on another local
machine/cluster, or in the cloud) that controls workflow execution, among other things. </p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong>You can control which version of SeqWare the CLI will use by setting the <code>SEQWARE_VERSION</code> environment variable, or modifying the associated value at the top of <code>~/bin/seqware</code>. For released versions, SeqWare will be downloaded automatically from the public repository.  If you specify a development release (i.e., suffixed with <code>-SNAPSHOT</code>), it is expected that you have built and installed SeqWare into your local Maven repository.  In all cases, the SeqWare JAR will be copied to <code>~/.seqware/self-installs</code> if it is not already present.</p>

<p>In the image below you get a glimpse of how these SeqWare tools fit together.
For users of the SeqWare system the command line tools, Web Service, or web
Portal application all provide access to the lifecycle of workflow usage. This
includes finding the workflows that are available, seeing what parameters they
take, launching a workflow on specified inputs/parameters, monitoring the
status, debugging the output if something goes wrong, and getting results back.
This process is pretty much identical whether SeqWare is installed locally on a
VirtualBox VM, running on a self-contained cloud instances, or a production
installation running on a real HPC cluster. In the image below the “Amazon S3”
and “Amazon EC2” components can be substituted with a shared NFS fileserver and
HPC cluster like a Sun Grid Engine cluster if SeqWare is used on a local,
non-cloud infrastructure. Likewise, the whole setup would be installed on a
single box if using a VirtualBox VM.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/images/seqware_tool_interaction.png" width="600px"></p>

<p>For more information about the command line tools see <code>seqware --help</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-seqware-settings-file">
<h2>The SeqWare Settings File</h2>

<p>SeqWare uses a simple configuration file that has been set up for
you already on the VM. By default the location is <code>/home/seqware/.seqware/settings</code>.</p>

<p>This file contains the web address of the SeqWare Web Service, your username
and password, Amazon public and private keys that will allow you to
push and pull data files to and from the cloud, etc. For this tutorial the
config file should be ready to go, you will not need to modify it.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Note:</strong>In addition to the settings needed to
schedule a workflow run, the provided settings file includes values needed to
launch workflow runs and interact with supporting systems. For now, you can
safely ignore them.</p>

<p>For more information see the <a href="../../6-pipeline/user-configuration/">Settings</a>
documentation which covers the details on the user config file.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-studies-experiments-and-samples">
<h2>Creating Studies, Experiments, and Samples</h2>

<p>This tutorial starts with creating a hierarchy of study, experiment, and sample objects in
the SeqWare MetaDB.  SeqWare MetaDB lets you track studies, experiment, and
samples and then link those to files (like FASTQ or something similar). You can
then run workflows on those files, track the resulting files, and use those
files for the next workflow.</p>

<p>You can run workflows without metadata writeback to the MetaDB (i.e., without tracking the provenance of output files), but most users
will want to associate a run of a workflow with a particular sample, so that is
why we start with setting up this information.  You will want to set up your
study, experiments, and samples before uploading your text or other data files.
This ensures you have “parents” to attach these files to.  Otherwise you will
not be able to use them as parameters for workflows. </p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong>You can use SeqWare Portal to edit the
entries you make with the command line tools (or create more studies,
experiments, and samples). See the <a href="../../5-portal/user-guide/">Portal
User Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<p>First, you can find out what objects this tool is capable of creating:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create --help

Usage: seqware create [--help]
       seqware create &lt;object&gt; [--help]

Description:
  Create new seqware objects (e.g., study).

Objects:
  experiment
  file
  ius
  lane
  sample
  sequencer-run
  study
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for a given object, you can find out what fields you need to specify:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create study --help

Usage: seqware create study [--help]
       seqware create study --interactive
       seqware create study &lt;fields&gt;

Note: It is strongly recommended that the '--interactive' mode be used when
      possible, since some columns have a dynamic set of allowable values.

Required fields:
  --accession &lt;val&gt;
  --center-name &lt;val&gt;
  --center-project-name &lt;val&gt;
  --description &lt;val&gt;
  --study-type &lt;val&gt;           Dynamic-valued field
  --title &lt;val&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As noted above, the simplest way for a human to enter this data would be to use <code>--interactive</code> option.  For now, we will use the scriptable input mechanism:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create study --title 'New Test Study' --description 'This is a test description' --accession 'InternalID123' --center-name 'SeqWare' --center-project-name 'SeqWare Test Project' --study-type 4

Created study with SWID: 2
</code></pre>

<p>The output of the above command is the SWID or “accession” number that uniquely identifies the object across the database, and is used used to link together
objects.  For example, you will use the above number to identify the parent for the experiment you create below.  If you do not track
and supply these numbers then the hierarchy of study/experiment/sample cannot
be created.</p>

<p>The next step is to create an experiment and link it to the study you created
above:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create experiment --title 'New Test Experiment' --description 'This is a test description' --platform-id 26 --study-accession 2

Created experiment with SWID: 3
</code></pre>

<p>Again, you use the SWID from the above output in the next step to create an
associated sample:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create sample --title 'New Test Sample' --description 'This is a test description' --organism-id 26 --experiment-accession 3

Created sample with SWID: 4
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you should have a nice study/experiment/sample hierarchy.  You
can, of course, add multiple samples per experiment and multiple experiments
per study.  For each of the samples you can now upload one or more files.  </p>

<div class="section" id="associating-files-with-a-sample">
<h3>Associating Files with a Sample</h3>

<p>So far we’ve created multiple objects inside the MetaDB.  Now we will create a “file” object that will be associated to the sample (SWID: 4) and reference a location on the file system.  First let’s create the input file:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo 'testing HelloWorld' &gt; /datastore/input.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we placed the file inside <code>/datastore</code> so that it can be visible to other users, namely the Portal and MapReduce. See the <a href="../../5-portal/">Portal documentation</a> for
information on setting the shared directory it expects to find uploaded files
in.</p>

<p>Now we can associate that file with a workflow and a run of a workflow (in this case, a stub ‘import’ workflow and a run of it): </p>

<pre><code>$ seqware create workflow --name FileImport --version 1.0 --description description
Added 'FileImport' (SWID: 5)
Created workflow 'FileImport' version 1.0 with SWID: 5

$ seqware create workflow-run  --workflow-accession 5 --file imported_file::text/plain::/datastore/input.txt --parent-accession 4
Created processing with SWID: 7
Created workflow run with SWID: 6
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the SWID returned is for a processing event, not the file itself (which has its own SWID). This processing SWID is what will be used below to attach a workflow run into the existing hierarchy.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong> you can find a list of the meta types
(like `chemical/seq-na-text-gzip` or `text/plain` above) at <a href="http://seqware.github.io/docs/16-module-conventions/">Module
Conventions - Module MIME Types</a>. This is the list we add to as needed when
creating new workflows.  It is extremely important to be consistent with these
since a workflow will not recognize your input unless the meta type string
matches what it expects exactly.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="listing-available-workflows-and-their-parameters">
<h2>Listing Available Workflows and Their Parameters</h2>

<p>The next step is to find the available workflows
and their parameters.  To see the list of available workflows you can execute
the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow list

-[ RECORD 0 ]----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name             | HelloWorld
Version          | 1.0-SNAPSHOT
Creation Date    | Mon Sep 30 16:58:18 UTC 2013
SeqWare Accession| 1
Bundle Location  | /home/seqware/released-bundles/Workflow_Bundle_HelloWorld_1.0-SNAPSHOT_SeqWare_1.1.0-beta.1.zip
</code></pre>

<p>The list of workflows (just one for now) shows the name, version, and 
the SWID of the installed workflows. You will use the SWID in the
next command to find all the parameters (and their defaults) that this workflow
takes:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow ini --accession 1

Created 'workflow.ini'.
</code></pre>

<p>In this example the configurable parameters of workflow “HelloWorld” (SWID: 1) are listed in <code>workflow.ini</code> (you can specify the output file with the <code>--out</code> option). Ini files are based on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.Reader%29">Java properties</a> file format.  </p>

<p>The file conforms to the input you can use to parameterize and launch workflows:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat workflow.ini

#key=input_file:type=file:display=F:display_name=input_file:file_meta_type=text/plain
input_file=${workflow_bundle_dir}/Workflow_Bundle_HelloWorld/1.0-SNAPSHOT/data/input.txt
#key=greeting:type=text:display=T:display_name=Greeting
greeting=Testing
#key=output_dir:type=text:display=F:display_name=output_dir
output_dir=seqware-results
#key=output_prefix:type=text:display=F:display_name=output_prefix
output_prefix=./
</code></pre>

<p class="warning"><strong>Important!:</strong> Make
sure the file that you create using this tool (and customize for later
launching a workflow) includes comment lines starting with “#” and the
key=value lines only.</p>

<p>You can customize any values from the key/value pairs that you need to.  For
example, the most frequent parameters you will customize are input files.  In
the workflow example above you will want to customize the values of <tt>input_file</tt> and <tt>output_prefix</tt>:</p>

<pre><code>input_file=/datastore/input.txt
output_prefix=/datastore/
</code></pre>

<p>Since this is a low-level tool you may see many more parameters exposed with
this tool than you would using the web Portal application.  Please use caution
when customizing these values since some refer to items that affect the
underlying infrastructure. Generally, when you see <tt>display=F</tt> that is
an indication that the parameter should usually be left as the default value.</p>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong> when you customize key-values in the
ini file prepared above you do not need to include key-values that you leave
unchanged.  If you do not include these the workflow will run with those values
by default anyway.  Removing unchanged key-values will greatly reduce the size
of your ini files making it much easier to see the key-values you are
interested in. In the example above the minimal ini file is simply the two
lines for <tt>input_file</tt> and <tt>output_prefix</tt>.</p>

<p>In summary, you should edit the <code>workflow.ini</code> changing it from:</p>

<pre><code>#key=input_file:type=file:display=F:display_name=input_file:file_meta_type=text/plain
input_file=${workflow_bundle_dir}/Workflow_Bundle_HelloWorld/1.0-SNAPSHOT/data/input.txt
#key=greeting:type=text:display=T:display_name=Greeting
greeting=Testing
#key=output_dir:type=text:display=F:display_name=output_dir
output_dir=seqware-results
#key=output_prefix:type=text:display=F:display_name=output_prefix
output_prefix=./
</code></pre>

<p>to the following:</p>

<pre><code>input_file=/datastore/input.txt
output_prefix=/datastore/
</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="section" id="scheduling-a-workflow-run-and-monitoring-progress">
<h2>Scheduling a Workflow Run and Monitoring Progress</h2>

<p>At this point you know what workflow you are going to run and you have a
customized ini file that contains the <tt>input_file</tt> and
<tt>output_prefix</tt>. The next step is to schedule the workflow using the ini
file you prepared (“schedule” because the actual launching of the workflow will be performed asynchronously by a background process). Make sure you use the correct workflow accession (SWID: 1) and input file accession (SWID: 7).</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow schedule --accession 1 --parent-accession 7 --ini workflow.ini --host `hostname --long` 

Created workflow run with SWID: 10 
</code></pre>

<p class="warning"><strong>Tip:</strong> the accession specifies which workflow to run, and the parent-accession is the SWID of the processing event that associated the input file with the sample.  This allows the workflow run to be linked into the study hierarchy. You MUST specify this
otherwise the workflow&#8217;s results will not be linked to anything (they will be
orphaned and will not be visible in the Portal or present in the reports
below).</p>

<p>This schedules the workflow to run on the VM. Notice it also prints the
workflow run accession which you can use to help monitor the workflow.</p>

<p>You can then monitor workflow progress (and getting a list of the outputs)
using the <code>workflow report</code> command. This will let you script the monitoring
of workflow runs. After about ten minutes, the workflow should complete. </p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow report --accession 1
-[ RECORD 0 ]------------------+-------------------------------------

</code></pre>

<p>This output includes several columns of interest including the status of the
workflow, the output file types, and their locations. See the <code>--help</code> for more options related to report generation.</p>

<p>The above reports all runs for the specified workflow. Alternately, you can just get the status of a particular workflow-run, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>seqware workflow-run report --accession 10 
</code></pre>

<p>You can download the stderr and stdout from the
workflow run, which can be useful for debugging failed runs:</p>

<pre><code>seqware workflow-run stderr --accession 10 
seqware workflow-run stdout --accession 10 
</code></pre>

<p>By default this command automatically creates output files for stderr and stdout,
for example <tt>20130930_175543__workflowrun_8_STDERR.csv</tt>.  You can
use the <tt>–out</tt> option if you wish to specify the file name.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-resulting-structure-in-metadb">
<h2>The Resulting Structure in MetaDB</h2>

<p>After a few minutes the HelloWorld workflow run should be
complete with a status of “completed”.  If you have followed the directions
carefully for creating a study, experiment, sample, and file in the MetaDB,
and running a workflow you should have a
structure very similar to the following present in the MetaDB:</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/images/20130414_sample_workflow_run.png" width="600px"></p>

<p>You can see the study, experiment, and sample linked together along with
a file processing event attached directly to the sample. This
event is associated with the <tt>input.txt</tt> file and it is the parent
of the first step in the HelloWorld workflow run. This workflow run
has three steps in this example and the final step is associated to the 
output file <tt>output.txt</tt>.  The processing event for Step3 could
then go on to become the parent for a subsequent workflow.</p>

<p>For a more detailed explination of the SeqWare MetaDB and the relationships it
encodes please see the <a href="../../4-metadb/">MetaDB Documentation</a>. You can use
either the <a href="../../5-portal/">Portal</a> or various reporting tools available in
the <a href="../../6-pipeline/">Pipeline</a> and/or <a href="../../7-web-service/">Web Service</a> to
explore the data structures and files created when running workflows.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="downloading-workflow-results">
<h2>Downloading Workflow Results</h2>

<p>Once a workflow has finished running you will want to list out the associated
output files and download the results.  While you can use the Portal for
downloading files the best way to get files in bulk is to use our reporting
tool. This produces a tab-delimited file that lists all the files produced for
the workflows you are interested in.  Since the report produces a simple
tab-delimited file you can easily automate the downloading of results by
looping over the output files.</p>

<p>First, you need to populate the file provenance report. You may wish to add
the following command to a cron on an interval depending on the size 
of your database and the number of workflows that you run. </p>

<pre><code>seqware files refresh 
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can download the report. Note that while this example filters by
study name, there are a large number of filters that can be used. </p>

<pre><code>seqware files report --study-name 'New Test Study'
</code></pre>

<p>The output is a Comma-Separated Values file that contains a line for
each file output for this workflow.</p>

<div class="section" id="output-files-provisioned-to-s3">
<h3>Output files provisioned to S3</h3>

<p>If the workflow run was configured to place output files in S3, you can use the file URLs in the report (such as
s3://bucket/samplename/test_R1.text.gz) to download results. In the local VM they are just local files so they do not
need to be copied.  Here is an example, though, of how to download a report
bundle that is hosted on Amazon’s S3:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware copy s3://bucket/results/seqware-0.10.0_ComprehensiveExomeGenomeAnalysis-0.10.5/59491657/GAG.fa.variant_quality.gatk.hg19.report.zip /home/seqware
</code></pre>

<p>Here the zip report bundle is downloaded to the seqware home directory.  In
this way you can pull back the results of workflows entirely through scripts.</p>

<p>Also note the study report gives you SWIDs for processing events and
entities such as studies, samples, and experiments.  You can use this report to
find these SWIDs that are used as “parents” for subsequent workflow runs.</p>

<p>You can find more information on this report tool by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware files report --help
</code></pre>

<div class="section" id="how-to-cancel-workflows">
<h2>How to Cancel Workflows</h2>

<p>After launching a workflow, you can cancel it in order to stop further execution. This will set the status of the workflow run to <code>submitted_cancel</code>, and after the next status propagation, will set the status to <code>cancelled</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow-run cancel --accession 28

<div class="section" id="how-to-retry-failed-and-cancelled-workflows">
<h2>How to Retry Failed and Cancelled Workflows</h2>

<p>If a workflow has failed due to a transient error (such as cluster downtime or a disk quota being reached), you can restart a workflow at the last failed step.</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow-run retry --accession 28
</code></pre>

<p>Alternately, you can retry workflow runs directly in HUE (this will also give more fine-grained control over which jobs should be rerun).  Note that status checking is normally skipped for failed/cancelled runs, thus SeqWare will need to be informed that the run has been retried externally:</p>

<pre><code>$ seqware workflow-run propagate-statuses --accession 28
</code></pre>

<p>As with the cancel case, the status is first set to <code>submitted_retry</code>, and after the next status propagation will be set to <code>running</code> (or whatever status is appropriate).</p>
